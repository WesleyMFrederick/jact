A high-fidelity UI design mockup of a modern SaaS landing page with a vintage comic book aesthetic.

**Image Settings:**
* **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (Landscape Web Layout).
* **Art Style:** A fusion of clean Swiss web design (bold typography, whitespace) and 1940s "Charles Atlas" comic advertisement style. Use halftone dot patterns, rough ink outlines, and a vintage off-white newsprint background texture (#F4F4F0).

**1. Navigation Bar (Top Left):**
* **Logo:** Bold, heavy text "JACT" with a small icon of a flexing bicep.
* **Sub-Logo Text:** Immediately to the right of the logo, in smaller, cleaner text: "(Just Another Context Tool)".

**2. Hero Section (The Main Content):**
* **Left Side (Typography & CTA):**
    * **Headline:** Massive, condensed, heavy black sans-serif text reading: **"AI WORKFLOWS TOO WEAK?"**
    * **Subhead:** A paragraph of typewriter-style text reading: **"Stop letting AI kick hallucinated content in your face. It’s time to Bulk up your Context. It’s time to Get JACT."**
    * **Styling Note:** The words "Bulk", "Context", and "Get JACT" in the subhead must be highlighted with a **thick, hand-drawn red marker stroke**.
    * **CTA Button:** A rectangular black button with a sharp red drop-shadow reading: **"GET JACT"**.

* **Right Side (The Comic Illustration):**
    * **Frame:** A large panel with a hand-drawn black ink border.
    * **The Bully:** A massive, hyper-muscular figure with a cloud for a head/torso, wearing wrestling trunks. On his chest, the text **"AI"** is written in block letters. He is grinning with toxic positivity.
    * **The Action:** The Bully is kicking a cloud of dust and debris into the face of a user.
    * **The Bully's Bubble:** A jagged speech bubble saying: **"You're absolutely right!"**
    * **The Debris:** Inside the dust cloud, small jagged text fragments read: **"404"**, **"[Fake Link]"**, **"{null}"**.
    * **The User:** A trembling wireframe skeleton (representing a user without data) shielding their face.
    * **The User's Bubble:** A small, desperate speech bubble saying: **"Stop guessing!"**

**3. Feature Section (Bottom of Page):**
* **Layout:** A horizontal 3-panel comic strip (triptych) running across the bottom width.
* **Panel 1 (Left) - "THE INPUT":** The Wireframe Skeleton holding a vintage canister labeled "JACT", pouring "data particles" (ones and zeros) into a funnel on its skull. Caption at top: **"STEP 1: INJECT CONTEXT"**.
* **Panel 2 (Center) - "THE PROCESS":** The skeleton transforming. Instead of biological muscles, it is growing "Data Muscles" (glowing wireframe grids and code blocks). Caption at top: **"STEP 2: ABSORB KNOWLEDGE"**.
* **Panel 3 (Right) - "THE RESULT":** The character is now a massive, fully-fleshed muscular hero with a "J" logo on his chest. He is effortlessly stopping a small, weak cloud labeled "Hallucination" with one hand. Caption at top: **"STEP 3: DOMINATE WORKFLOW"**.
