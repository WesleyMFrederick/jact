> [!objective] CRITICAL WORKFLOW
> 1. Run !`/continous-learning` skill
> 2. Use !`/caveman` to save on tokens while writing plan
> 3. ON STARTUP, ALWAYS Ingest this document, run skills, return status in chat window, BECAUSE USER needs to know what we worked on last and what needs to happen next

### Type I/II

%% *Last Modified: 05/01/26 17:13:37* %%

| Type | Action | Examples |
|------|--------|----------|
| I (irrev) | HARD GATE → USER | Lock, scope chg, framework |
| II (rev) | AGENT auto | Read, grep, tables |

## 2. Context

%% *Last Modified: 05/01/26 17:13:37* %%

**Change:** `jact` default-scope for `extract file/header/links` + minimal output default for `extract file/header` (match `validate`).

**Why:** USER ran `jact extract file b1-cli-entry-options-decode-design.md` from repo cwd → "File not found". Re-ran w/ abs `--scope` → worked. Same friction codified in user CLAUDE.md as JACT SCOPE RULE workaround → not fix.

**Friction:** USER + AGENT burn tokens on abs paths every call. Natural root inferable from cwd or target file. Also: `extract file` dumps verbose JSON; `validate` already has minimal-default + `--verbose`.

**Entry:** Baseline problem (concrete repro + explicit ideals).

## 3. Artifacts

%% *Last Modified: 05/01/26 17:26:04* %%

| Artifact | Path | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| Repro | (current session) | Primary evidence — fail w/o `--scope`, pass w/ abs `--scope` |
| CLI src | `src/jact.ts` | Target — defines `extract file` (1394–1437), `extract header` (1334–1392), `extract links` (1276–1332); `validate` minimal/verbose split (324–515) |
| `extractFile` | `src/jact.ts:738-813` | Target — `if (options.scope) buildCache(scope)`, no fallback |
| `extractHeader` | `src/jact.ts:645-701` | Target — same |
| `extractLinks` | `src/jact.ts:555-606` | Target — same |
| `validate` | `src/jact.ts:181-256` | Reference — minimal default + `--verbose` |
| `formatExtractResult` | `src/formatExtractResult.ts` | Reference — current formatter (md/json) |
| `FileCache` | `src/FileCache.ts` | Target — Row 5 ambiguous-match: `resolveFile()` 175-229, `duplicates` Set<string> 62/78-79, `addToCache` 153-160 silent overwrite |
| User CLAUDE.md | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (JACT TOOL RULES) | Evidence — workaround rule = unfixed friction |
| Project CLAUDE.md | `jact/CLAUDE.md` | Reference — current invocation patterns |

## 4. Phase 1 — Findings

%% *Last Modified: 05/01/26 17:13:37* %%

| ID | Pattern | Scope | Trigger | Friction |
|----|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| F1 | `jact extract file <name>` from repo cwd w/o `--scope` → "File not found" tho file in repo | extract file/header/links | Call from inside project where cwd or target loc → root | Re-run w/ abs `--scope`. Token burn. Codified globally as workaround. |
| F2 | `extract file` always dumps full JSON (`extractedContentBlocks` + `outgoingLinksReport` + `stats`). `validate` has minimal default + `--verbose`. Extract didn't follow. | extract file/header (json default) | Caller wants content only, gets metadata + link report + stats | Wasted ctx tokens. Inconsistent CLI ergonomics same tool. |
| F3 | Friction → permanent rule in user CLAUDE.md, not CLI fix | Cross-project | Every project + agent using `jact` | Permanent cog tax. Rule replicates → not eliminated at source. |

### Hardcoded refs

%% *Last Modified: 05/01/26 17:13:37* %%

| Line(s) | What | Issue |
|---------|------|-------|
| `src/jact.ts:561, 652, 744` | `if (options.scope) fileCache.buildCache(options.scope)` | No fallback — undefined → skip cache → cwd-relative fail |
| `src/jact.ts:1281, 1339, 1398` | Commander `--scope <folder>` no default | Every call needs explicit pass |

## 5. Phase 2 — BI

%% *Last Modified: 05/01/26 17:27:20* %%

| # | Actor | Baseline [O] | Ideal [O] |
|---|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | User invoking tool | User must declare search root every call resolving by name, even from inside project w/ identifiable root. | User from inside known project resolves by name w/o declaring root; declares only to override default. |
| 2 | Agent invoking tool for user | Agent rebuilds abs search root every call — re-runs discovery or reads global memory rule prescribing it. | Agent from inside known project resolves by name w/o rebuilding root; explicit declaration only for cross-project. |
| 3 | User receiving extract output | User gets full structured payload (content + link reports + stats) every call regardless of need. | User gets only content asked for by default; opts into payload when needed. |
| 4 | Agent maintaining tool rules | Agent carries persistent global rule prescribing workaround for missing default, applied in every project. | Agent reaches for rules only on genuine cross-project ambiguity; natural-root rule retires. |
| 5 | User resolving ambiguous name match | User experiences silent wrong-file resolution or opaque failure when a name matches multiple candidates within the inferred root. | User receives an actionable disambiguation prompt naming every candidate when a name matches multiple files within the inferred root, and the tool halts until the user picks one or narrows the call. |

**Self-checks:**
- Like-for-like: every cell = [O]. ✓
- Tool-strip: cells use "tool", "extract invocation", "search root", "structured payload" — abstract, no `--scope`/`jact`/flag names. ✓
- Immutability: Baselines = observed reality (repro + CLAUDE.md rule). ✓

## 6. Phase 4 — Source Mapping

### Source Map [h4]

%% *Last Modified: 05/01/26 17:27:20* %%

| # | Baseline [O] | Source ID | Source | Baseline Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | User declares search root every call | S1a | `src/jact.ts:561` | `extractLinks`: `if (options.scope) buildCache(scope)` — undefined → skip cache → cwd-relative resolve fails. |
| 1 | "" | S1b | `src/jact.ts:652` | `extractHeader`: same no-fallback pattern. |
| 1 | "" | S1c | `src/jact.ts:744` | `extractFile`: same. |
| 1 | "" | S1d | `src/jact.ts:1281` | Commander `--scope <folder>` no default — `extract links`. |
| 1 | "" | S1e | `src/jact.ts:1339` | Commander `--scope <folder>` no default — `extract header`. |
| 1 | "" | S1f | `src/jact.ts:1398` | Commander `--scope <folder>` no default — `extract file`. |
| 2 | Agent rebuilds abs search root every call | S2a | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` JACT SCOPE RULE | Global rule mandates abs `--scope` per call — workaround codified, every project + agent inherits cog tax. |
| 2 | "" | S2b | `src/jact.ts:561,652,744` | Same no-fallback root cause as Row 1; agent compensates via S2a. |
| 3 | User gets full structured payload every call | S3a | `src/jact.ts:1394-1437` | `extract file`: no `--verbose` opt; line 1426 `console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2))` — always full dump. |
| 3 | "" | S3b | `src/jact.ts:1334-1392` | `extract header`: `--format markdown\|json` (default md) but no minimal/verbose split — md still includes link reports + stats via formatter. |
| 3 | "" | S3c | `src/jact.ts:181-256` (REF) | `validate`: minimal default + `--verbose` opt-in (`options.verbose`) — pattern to mirror. |
| 3 | "" | S3d | `src/formatExtractResult.ts` | Md/json formatter — no minimal-vs-verbose layer. |
| 3 | "" | S3e | `src/jact.ts:592` | `extractLinks`: `console.log(JSON.stringify(extractionResult, null, 2))` — always full. |
| 4 | Agent carries global rule prescribing workaround | S4a | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` JACT SCOPE RULE | Codified workaround. Same source as S2a, different actor lens (rule maintenance, not invocation). |
| 4 | "" | S4b | `jact/CLAUDE.md` | Project doc shows abs `--scope` in every example invocation — replicates rule downstream. |
| 5 | User halted by actionable disambiguation on multi-match | S5a | `src/FileCache.ts:175-229` | `resolveFile()` returns generic msg ("Multiple files named X found in scope") on duplicate — no candidate paths listed. |
| 5 | "" | S5b | `src/FileCache.ts:62,78-79` | `duplicates: Set<string>` stores filenames only, not paths. Cannot enumerate candidates without re-scan. |
| 5 | "" | S5c | `src/FileCache.ts:153-160` | `addToCache()`: first path wins; subsequent duplicates discarded silently — original-vs-dup paths both unrecoverable from public API. |
| 5 | "" | S5d | `src/jact.ts:766-779` | `extractFile` pathConversion uses single recommended path — no halt-on-ambiguity flow.
